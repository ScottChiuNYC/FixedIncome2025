    "* Exotic desk traders hedge their books by trading vanilla products\n",
    "* Vanilla desk traders do so by trading underlying linear products (SOFR swaps, FRA or futures)\n",
    "* More complicated models are needed for exotics pricing and hedging\n",
    "    * Since exotics are hedged by vanillas, the pricing model has to give consistent pricing of both exotics and vanillas\n",
    "    * Thus, the models are calibrated to vanillas"
