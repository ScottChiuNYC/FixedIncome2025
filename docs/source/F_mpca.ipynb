    "In curve PCA, we put together all daily curve movement (row) vectors from the past 3 months and form a data matrix $X$. We then perform SVD to obtain \n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = TV^{\\mathsf T}, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $T$ is the PC score matrix, and $V^{\\mathsf T}$ is a unitary matrix whose rows are the principal components $\\vec v_1^{\\mathsf T}, \\vec v_2^{\\mathsf T}, \\vec v_3^{\\mathsf T}, \\ldots$. \n",

    "Similarly, in vol surface MPCA, we put together all daily vol surface movement matrices from the past 3 months to form a 3-dimensional data cube $Z$. We then perform the [higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_singular_value_decomposition) which will give us two unitary matrices $A$ and $B$, and a 3-dimensional score cube $U$, such that any specific layer of the score cube $U^{(k)}$ and its corresponding vol surface movement matrix $Z^{(k)}$ (from a specific date) satisfy the identity \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z^{(k)} = AU^{(k)}B^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n",

    "The unitary matrices $A$ and $B$ together play the same role as $V$ in SVD. Denote the column vectors of $A$ by $\\vec a_1, \\vec a_2, \\ldots$, and the column vectors of $B$ by $\\vec b_1, \\vec b_2, \\ldots$. The multilinear principal component surfaces are the [outer product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product) $\\vec a_i\\otimes \\vec b_j$. \n",

Empirically, on the USD swaption vol surface, the 4 terms combined can often explain over $90\\%$ of the variances of the data. Given today's EOD vega matrix $D$, same size as $Z$, tomorrow's PnL is sum of elementwise products of $D$ and $Z$, which is conveniently given by the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)) of $ZD^{\\mathsf T}$, which we denote by $\\text{tr}(ZD^{\\mathsf T})$.
